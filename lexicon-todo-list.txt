TBD: Add :minstrel: -- already in LifeWiki
TBD: Add :knightwave:, :errant minstrel:, :ragged minstrel:, :wandering minstrel:, :featherweight minstrel:, :lightweight minstrel:, :heavyweight minstrel:
     Add alias link for :M0:, :Minstrel 0:?

TBD:  Add :upconverter:, :downconverter: (link to {converter}) -- already in LifeWiki
      Add calcyman's definition:  "If the output {signal} is more complex than the input signal, this can be called an upconverter.  A conduit that converts a rarer or more complex object into a simpler one is a downconverter." -- already in LifeWiki

TBD:  Add :doubled-signal toolkit: -- or possibly :G0 toolkit:?  See how the terminology shakes out.

TBD: Review :glider synthesis:
     > For Release 30 it would probably be worth mentioning in each relevant spaceship article
     >   the discoverer and date of all the recent glider syntheses.

TBD: pointer from :17c/45 spaceship: to :pi climber: and vice versa.

TBD: Pattern of the Year 2018 updates --

0E0P metacell	Adam P. Goucher
A unit cell which does not require a background grid of metacells to function, proving the existence of unusual classes of patterns such as quadratic replicators and RROs in Conway's Game of Life "imported" from other rules.
Reverse caber-tosser	Adam P. Goucher, Dave Greene, Chris Cain
A complex mechanism which theoretically allows any glider-synthesisable pattern to be synthesised in just 35 gliders, by encoding the pattern's complexity into the distance between the gliders rather than their quantity.
Turing Machine simulator	Michael Simkin
A script which can simulate arbitrary Turing machines in Conway's Game of Life using a finite tape.
Camelship	Chris Cain
A self-constructing oblique spaceship with the minimum possible step size for a slope 3 spaceship.
New self-constructing spaceships	Dave Greene
A loopship, along with HashLife-friendly variants of Orthogonoid and Demonoid.
c/2 diagonal telegraph recipe	Martin Grant
A 140-glider recipe to create a detectable c/2 diagonal signal traveling non-destructively along an arbitrarily long barge or ship.
Period-52 glider gun	Dave Greene, Matthias Merzenich, Adam P. Goucher, Chris Cain, Entity Valkyrie
The first true-period 52 gun constructed, which was later vastly reduced using 53P13.
Stable line crosser	Dave Greene, Goldtiger997, Chris Cain
A modernized rehash of a periodic circuit for transmitting a glider across a diagonal line of cells found by David Bell.
Jormungant's G-to-H	Louis-François Handfield (Jormungant)
A 2G-to-H converter with a short recovery time, allowing for the optimization of numerous guns.
Period-33 glider gun	Arie Paap, Matthias Merzenich
The first true-period 33 gun, which uses two interacting copies of Jason's p33.
Infinite distinct diagonal spaceships and infinite distinct orthogonal spaceships	Adam P. Goucher, Goldtiger997
Two guns which each use sqrtgun mechanisms to fire infinitely many distinct spaceships, all of which are puffers whose outputs are eaten by spaceships arbitrarily far away.
Sierpinski triangle generator	Luka Okanishi
A breeder that outputs gliders in the shape of a growing Sierpinski triangle.
Cottonmouth	AforAmpere
An infinitely extensible pushalong for the copperhead and fireship.
5c/9 signal injector	Rhombic, Simon Ekström, Chris Cain
A method of transforming Herschels to 5c/9 drifters with a recovery time of 62.
p46 gliderless LWSS gun	Nathaniel Johnston
The smallest known gliderless LWSS gun, using three copies of Tanner's p46.
Bronco	Tanner Jacobi
The second elementary glider-to-Herschel converter to be discovered.
New high-period oscillators	carybe
A collective entry for p36 shuttle, 34P14 shuttle, 68P16, and p64 thunderbird hassler, all discovered using apgsearch.
Quinti-Snarks	Tanner Jacobi
Period-quintupling reflectors useful for guns.
Pseudo-period xWSS guns	Chris Cain, Adam P. Goucher, Entity Valkyrie, 2718281828, Goldtiger997
New xWSS guns with pseudo-periods ranging from 18 to 21, breaking the previous record of 22.
Self-constructing oscillator with strict volatility one	Dave Greene, Goldtiger997
A method of constructing strictly volatile oscillators with any period 3,506,910 or above.
p3 bumper	Arie Paap, Tanner Jacobi
A periodic reflector to work at p39, which also allowed for the construction of a p57 bumper loop
Goldtiger997's Amazing 2 in 1 Reusable Multipurpose Minstrel Remover and Detector™	Goldtiger997
A circuit capable of removing every known Minstrel from Sir Robin at the time of its construction.
New mid-period sparkers	Dongook Lee, Josh Ball, Martin Grant, Aidan F. Pierce, carybe, Bullet51
A collective entry for various sparking oscillators with periods ranging from 7 to 10, including but not limited to 68P9 and 55P10.
Minstrel 4	Entity Valkyrie
A manually-assembled Sir Robin tagalong which combines Minstrels 1 and 3.
Period-doubling fireship tagalong	christoph.r
A tagalong for a flotilla of three fireships which increases its period to 20.

The fastest known p4 reflector.
Huge 2D-extensible wick-supporting pushalong	Hartmut Holzwart
Non-monotonic 2c/5 orthogonal spaceship	Arie Paap, Matthias Merzenich, Bullet51

p6 180-degree reflector and related guns	Arie Paap, Tanner Jacobi, Louis-François Handfield
A reflector which can be used alongside other sparkers to create arbitrary guns with period (60n+30).
Fast universal regulators	Dave Greene
Homer ( =42883M)	Adam P. Goucher
A 16×16 soup found by apgsearch, and the longest-lasting known methuselah fitting within a 16×16 bounding box.
New honey farm hasslers
A collective entry for a few oscillators of periods 36 and 40 which use honey farm-hassling reactions.
