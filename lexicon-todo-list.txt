TBD: Add :minstrel: -- already in LifeWiki

     Add alias link for :M0:, :Minstrel 0:?

TBD:  Add :upconverter:, :downconverter: (link to {converter}) -- already in LifeWiki
      Add calcyman's definition:  "If the output {signal} is more complex than the input signal, this can be called an upconverter.  A conduit that converts a rarer or more complex object into a simpler one is a downconverter." -- already in LifeWiki

TBD:  Add :doubled-signal toolkit: -- or possibly :G0 toolkit:?  See how the terminology shakes out.

TBD: Review :glider synthesis:
     > For Release 30 it would probably be worth mentioning in each relevant spaceship article
     >   the discoverer and date of all the recent glider syntheses.

Infinite distinct diagonal spaceships and infinite distinct orthogonal spaceships	Adam P. Goucher, Goldtiger997

A method of constructing strictly volatile oscillators with any period 3,506,910 or above.

A circuit capable of removing every known Minstrel from Sir Robin at the time of its construction.
New mid-period sparkers	Dongook Lee, Josh Ball, Martin Grant, Aidan F. Pierce, carybe, Bullet51
A collective entry for various sparking oscillators with periods ranging from 7 to 10, including but not limited to 68P9 and 55P10.
Minstrel 4	Entity Valkyrie
A manually-assembled Sir Robin tagalong which combines Minstrels 1 and 3.
Period-doubling fireship tagalong	christoph.r
A tagalong for a flotilla of three fireships which increases its period to 20.
